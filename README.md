 ## How To Play
### Notation
* Columns are denoted with letters a-h from left
* Rows are denoted with numbers 1-8 from bottom

### Rules
 * You can move one checker in one direction at a time, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. 
 * The total number of checkers (including your opponents) in that column (aka file), row (aka rank), or diagonal path determines how many spaces that checker must move, if moved. 
 * Your checkers can jump over your own checkers, but cannot land on your checkers. 
 * Your checkers can land on your opponent’s checkers, but cannot jump over your opponent’s checkers. 
 * Landing on your opponent’s checker, removes that checker from the game. 
 * Black moves first. 
 * The winner is the first player to connect all of their checkers still on the board. 
    * In the event that one move results in a connection for both players, the game traditionally results in a draw. 
    * Additionally, when a player has only one remaining checker on the board, that player wins, as one checker is considered a continuous line.
    
### Example
![Fig1](./img/fig1.png)
* (a) Initial Position
* (b) Possible moves for the black piece at f3. 
    * In (b) the piece at f3 cannot move horizontally to the right because it would be forced to move 4 steps, which would push it off the board. 
    * The same piece cannot move vertically up because there are 4 pieces in the vertical line of action and moving 4 steps up would require it to move over enemy pieces
 
![Fig2](./img/fig2.png)
* End positions. 
* Position (a) is a win for Black. 
* In position (b), White can move as shown, capturing an isolated black piece and giving both players contiguous pieces. Since it is White's move, however, the result is counted as a winning position for White.

 ### Controlling Play
 * Master the middle, control the game. 
 * The best offense is a good defense. 
 * Stay ahead. Few > Many. Finding the Game Winning Spot.

## Running the Application
To run the application and start playing this board game, you will first need to clone the repository to your local computer.
```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone git@github.com:DirajThajali/LinesOfAction.git
```
Now that you have all the required tools to run the board game, you have two options: play it on your standard terminal or use Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
### Running on Terminal
```bash
$ javac loa/*.java      # compile all java classes
$ java -ea loa.Main     # this will run the program on your terminal
```
### Running it using GUI  
```bash
$ javac loa/*.java      # compile all java classes
$ java -ea loa.Main --display       # this will run the program using GUI
```
